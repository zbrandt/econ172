    We often study the effect of interventions on those who actually 
    received treatment. However, it is possible that economic 
    interventions can create positive externalities for non-recipient 
    households, for instance, through market interactions or financial 
    transfers between households. In this part of the problem set, we 
    will estimate the spillover effects of a fictitious cash transfer 
    program in a rural Tanzanian setting.

    Starting in 2015, imagine that thousands of households in rural 
    northern Tanzania received large cash transfers of roughly US 
    \$1,000 from the international non-governmental organization 
    GiveDirectly (GD). These cash transfers were targeted to relatively 
    poor households within certain villages but not others. The cash 
    grants were unconditional, and the amount is equivalent to more 
    than 50\% of total annual income for many recipient households. GD 
    expanded cash transfers in some villages and not others in a 
    non-randomized fashion. Then in 2018, approximately three years 
    after the distribution of the cash transfers, the households were 
    surveyed and measures were collected on many economic, social and 
    life outcomes, including household per capita income.

    The goal of this question is to estimate the impact of these 
    transfers on the households deemed to be too wealthy to be eligible 
    for GD transfers. Comparisons will be made across these ineligible 
    households in the "cash" villages (locations where poor households 
    received cash transfers from GD) versus in control villages (where 
    poor household did not receive GD transfers). Any effects on these 
    ineligible households can be considered spillovers since none of 
    them received cash transfers through the program.
        
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Discuss the econometric assumptions needed to make a 
            difference-in-differences (DD) approach appropriate in the case 
            of understanding the spillover impacts of cash transfers on 
            household incomes.

        \item Why is it important that we have access to data from both 
            the baseline (pre-intervention) and endline (post-intervention) 
            survey rounds?

        \item How does the lack of randomization in the allocation of cash 
            transfers across villages affect the estimation of treatment 
            effects, and how might it lead to omitted variable bias?

        \item Please download the data to be used in the analysis. The 
            dataset \texttt{Ec172\_Fall25\_PS2Q2\_data.csv} is a partial 
            extract of project data (although the actual data has been 
            modified in various ways). Each observation (row) in the dataset 
            represents one household in one time period.

        All households in this problem set dataset are 
        \textbf{ineligible} for the GD cash transfers (i.e., they are 
        too wealthy to receive cash transfers). There are two 
        observations for each household, one from the baseline survey 
        (time=0) and one from the endline survey (time=1). Using the 
        \texttt{lm.cluster} command, determine the average difference at 
        baseline (time=0) between the households in villages where 
        eligible households received cash transfers (\texttt{cash}=1) 
        versus the households in control villages that did not receive 
        transfers (\texttt{cash}=0) for each of the following two 
        characteristics: household income per capita 
        (\texttt{income\_pc}) and if the household has an elderly member 
        (\texttt{elder}=1). Importantly, these characteristics were 
        collected by the survey team in the baseline survey before the 
        cash transfers were sent out. (Consider these two 
        characteristics one by one, that is, you should run two separate 
        regressions here.) Make sure to account for the correlation 
        among households in the same village by ``clustering'' your 
        standard errors by village (\texttt{village\_code}).

        \textbf{Hint:} To cluster SEs we can use the 
        \texttt{lm.cluster} command or the \texttt{feols} command. To use 
        the \texttt{lm.cluster} command in R, first install the packages 
        \texttt{miceadds} and \texttt{sandwich}, and then load them into 
        your library. The \texttt{lm.cluster} command functions just like 
        \texttt{lm}, but with the added option to specify a clustering 
        variable.

        For the \texttt{feols} command, install and load the 
        \texttt{fixest} package. Clustering is specified at the end of 
        the command using \texttt{, cluster ~ village\_code}. The syntax 
        of \texttt{feols} is otherwise similar to \texttt{lm}, except 
        that you do not include \texttt{formula =} before the regression 
        equation.

        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Report the regression output for the two regressions 
                mentioned above, and interpret the coefficients. Please 
                also discuss the standard errors and t-statistics. Taken 
                together, are ineligible households similar in cash 
                villages versus control villages along these two 
                dimensions? How does this finding inform the discussion of 
                the validity of the difference-in-differences (DD) 
                approach that you laid out above, if at all?
            \item Carry out a difference-in-differences (DD) analysis 
                estimating the spillover impact of GD cash transfers 
                among ineligible households, where the outcome of interest 
                is per capita income (\texttt{income\_pc}). You will need 
                to use data from both time periods. Once again, make sure 
                to account for the correlation among households in the 
                same village by clustering by village 
                (\texttt{village\_code}). 
                
                (Hint: recall that a DD analysis requires the inclusion 
                of separate explanatory variables for post 
                (\texttt{time}), treatment (\texttt{cash}), and an 
                interaction between the two variables. Note you will need 
                to create a new variable in your dataset for this 
                interaction term.) 
                
                What is the spillover impact among ineligible households 
                when poor households in their village receive large cash 
                transfers? Is this effect significantly different from 
                zero at 95\% confidence?
            \item Discuss at least two reasons why cash transfers 
                received by other households in one's village might 
                generate spillover effects over time even among 
                non-recipient households. Given these likely mechanisms, 
                does the magnitude of the estimated effect in part (b) 
                seem plausible? If not, why not?
        \end{enumerate}
