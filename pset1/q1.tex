\begin{homeworkProblem}{Short questions}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item What is the poverty gap? What is the drawback of poverty head 
        count ratio. What is the advantage of Poverty gap over the headcount 
        ratio?
        \item Consider a country in which 20 percent of the population live on 
        20 cents per day, 15 percent live on 30 cents per day, 15 percent live 
        on 50 cents per day, 10 percent live on 70 cents per day, 20 percent 
        live on 90 cents per day, and 20 percent live on 1.50 dollars per day. 
        If the poverty line is set at one dollar per day, what is the poverty 
        headcount ratio? What is the poverty gap? What is the poverty severity?
        \item Show an example that $P_1$ (poverty gap) and P2 (poverty 
        severity) can change while $P_0$ (headcount ratio) is fixed. (You may 
        not need to calculate each value)
        \item How $P_0$ (headcount ratio), $P_1$ (poverty gap), $P_2$ (poverty 
        severity) change in graph (a), (b), (c) between situation 1 (black 
        line) and situation 2 (blue line)?
